                    Machine Learning model trained on data from the Balancing Mechanism Reporting System (<a

                <h5 class="mt-4">How the Forecast Works</h5>
                <p>
                    AgilePredict uses an <strong>XGBoost Gradient Boosting Regressor</strong> to forecast electricity
                    prices based on a blend of weather and energy market data. Here's an overview of how it works:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Data Collection:</strong> Forecasts and actual prices are sourced from NG ESO, BMRS,
                        Open-Meteo, and historical Agile data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Time-based and derived features like peak hours, days
                        since forecast, and weekend indicators are calculated.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Training Focus:</strong> The model trains on the data closest to 16:15 daily (aligned
                        with auction timing) and targets the PM auction period (22:00–22:00 next day).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Modeling:</strong> The XGBoost model is trained using log-weighted errors to better
                        capture high-volatility pricing. It uses cross-validation to validate accuracy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Prediction:</strong> New forecasts are generated, and confidence intervals are estimated
                        using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Blending:</strong> Model outputs are blended with actual prices and extended into future
                        time slots. Forecasts include a central prediction, and low/high bounds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Publishing:</strong> Results are stored and published for multiple UK regions with
                        Agile-compatible pricing.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The forecasts are updated automatically four times per day: at 06:15, 10:15, 16:15, and 22:15. The
                    accuracy tends to be stronger for general trends rather than exact half-hour slots, especially
                    further into the future.
                </p>

                <p>
                    AgilePredict is a work in progress. Please use the forecasts with care and always check with
                    official pricing when it matters.
