## Developing for this project

This project is made using Python and Django. Here is some instructions to get you started if you want to develop for the project.

### Create a virtual environment

As with all python projects, it is recommended to create a virtual environment. For example, in this project, create a virtual environment using python's built in virtual environment tool `venv` to create an virtual environment in a folder `.venv`:

```
cd agile_predict
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Then, each time you are developing, activate the virtual environment according to the OS you are using.

Windows:

```
./.venv/Scripts/activate
```

### Installing dependencies

Requirements are listed in `requirements.txt`. You may install these however you like. The usual way is via python pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the project

Run the project via the Django manage.py script. It's as simple as:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

Have fun!
